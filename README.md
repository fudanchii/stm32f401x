Rust board support package for ARM STM32F401x (e.g. Nucleo F401RE)

This crate is self contained, it's a separate implementation from [Rust embedded](https://github.com/rust-embedded) cortex-m effort.

device internals related code were derived with rust-bindgen from [prof7bit/bare_metal_stm32f401xe](https://github.com/prof7bit/bare_metal_stm32f401xe)
